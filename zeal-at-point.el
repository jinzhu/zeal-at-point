;; Commentary:
;;
;; Add the following to your .emacs:
;;
;;   (require 'zeal-at-point)
;;   (global-set-key "\C-cd" 'zeal-at-point)
;;
;; Run `zeal-at-point' to search the word at point, then Zeal is
;; launched and search the word. To edit the search term first,
;; use C-u to set the prefix argument for `zeal-at-point'.
;;
;; Run `zeal-at-point-set-docset' to set docset for current buffer
;;
;; Zeal queries can be narrowed down with a docset prefix.  You can
;; customize the relations between docsets and major modes.
;;
;;   (add-to-list 'zeal-at-point-mode-alist '(perl-mode . "perl"))
;;
;; Additionally, the buffer-local variable `zeal-at-point-docset' can
;; be set in a specific mode hook (or file/directory local variables)
;; to programmatically override the guessed docset.  For example:
;;
;;   (add-hook 'rinari-minor-mode-hook
;;             (lambda () (setq zeal-at-point-docset "rails")))
;;
;;
;; Thanks dash-at-point.el (https://github.com/stanaka/dash-at-point), I copied lots of code from it!
